Answers for technical questions:
1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding assignment then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add. 
14 Hours
If I'd spend more time on this assignment I would add better unittests. I'd also take the time to convert the Json response with cleaner code.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your language of choice? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
global using directives (please see Usings.cs files within project)

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this? 
I would use unit tests, these return the amount of time it would take to kick-off the code. And I guess I would use the debugger with breakpoints to see where the code takes the most time. I’ve had to do it before, but it was more to experiment wether the code could be improve (performance wise), not to actually solve a performance issue.

4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn? 
I haven’t read any technical books, nor been to a tech conference. I did follow quite a few online courses on Pluralsight. The latest ones I’ve followed was “Mocking with Moq 4 and Xunit” and “C# 10 Design Patterns” (Didn’t finish this one yet)

5. What do you think about this technical assessment? 
I guess this is a technical assessment for an experienced developer, because I’ve spend 14 hours on this. I don’t think an assessment should take that long.

6. Please, describe yourself using JSON.
